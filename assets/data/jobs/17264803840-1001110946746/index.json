We are a startup developing a next-generation, no-compromises data analytics platform that will revolutionize the industry. Our proprietary technology lets us efficiently process datasets with tens of millions of rows in the browser, and interactively visualize them. We take pride in platform‚Äôs UX and performance, and take advantage of the technologies such as WebAssembly, WebGL, and browser-based multithreaded computations. We have a very well established development process that includes unit tests, continuous integration system, stress tests, integration tests, automated UI testing system, and various deployment options. Our technology stack is primarily based on Dart and Postgres, but also has multiple extension points with components developed in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, R, Java, and C++. Initially you will be involved in developing new plugins in JavaScript, and extending platform‚Äôs core capabilities to enable that.\n\nThere is a lot of room to grow, and there will be many opportunities to assume more responsibilities and learn new domains, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, or high-performance computing.\n\nThis is a remote position.\nIt would be great if you could send us a project you have developed on your own (github repository is ok), or point to another project you have participated in. \n\nResponsibilities\n* Front-end and back-end web development\n* Maintain and improve developer-facing platform‚Äôs JS API\n* Help our clients write JS applications on top of the Datagrok platform\n* Develop proof-of-concept applications\n* Integrate third-party JS libraries into the platform\n\nRequirements\n* At least two years of professional experience\n* JavaScript or TypeScript\n* At least one of (Angular, React, Vue)\n* Good written English, ability to communicate directly with our clients\n* Strong verbal and written communication skills\n* Ability to learn and apply new technologies\n\nNice to have\n* One of (Python, R, Java, C#, C++)\n* WebGL\n* WebAssembly\n* Dart\n* Machine learning and statistics\n* Prior exposure to life sciences is a plus\n\n‚Äî\n\nüëâ –û–±—Å—É–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–∞–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∏–∏ –≤ —á–∞—Ç–µ @javascript_jobs","markup":[{"type":"hashtag","offset":0,"length":9,"data":"–≤–∞–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∏—è"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":10,"length":9,"data":"frontend"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":20,"length":11,"data":"javascript"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":32,"length":7,"data":"senior"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":40,"length":8,"data":"vacancy"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":49,"length":7,"data":"remote"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":57,"length":9,"data":"—É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∫–∞"},{"type":"hashtag","offset":67,"length":9,"data":"fulltime"},{"type":"link","offset":101,"length":19,"data":"https://datagrok.ai"},{"type":"handle","offset":211,"length":9,"data":"alexaprm"},{"type":"link","offset":223,"length":11,"data":"http://Datagrok.ai"},{"type":"handle","offset":2452,"length":16,"data":"javascript_jobs"}],"date":"2020-06-30T12:32:35+00:00","link":"tg://resolve?domain=javascript_jobs_feed&post=16465","tags":[{"name":"javascript"},{"name":"deployment"},{"name":"dart"},{"name":"postgresql"},{"name":"typescript"},{"name":"python"},{"name":"java"},{"name":"github"},{"name":"web"},{"name":"angularjs"},{"name":"reactjs"},{"name":"vuejs"},{"name":"continuous-integration"},{"name":"machine-learning"}],"cities":[{"code":"nice","ruName":"–ù–∏—Å","enName":"Nice","country":{"code":"montenegro","ruName":"–ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—è","enName":"Montenegro"}}],"allowsRemote":true}},"context":{"recordId":"17264803840-1001110946746"}}
